## Emergency Shutdown:

In the case of a system upgrade or unpredicatble emergencies, such as market irrationality, a hack, or a security breach, emergency shutdown is triggerd. 

**Emergency Shutdown contract** stops and shuts down the Morgage contract, ensuring that no more loans can be created, therefore no FAN will be issued afterwards. While borrower is still able to redeem their colleteral, and the lender can keep liquidating the colleteral.

The process of emergency shutdown is controlled by govenance token holders, who can trigger it by depositing FAN-G into the emergency shutdown contract, and call cage(...)  to execute. Once users deposit FAN-G into the ES, it is locked in the contract.
